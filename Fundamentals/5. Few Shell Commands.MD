ðŸ’¡ **Notes**:
- `-r` or `-R` â€” recursive copy.
- `-a` â€” archive mode (same as `-rpP`).

## ðŸ“‚ `pwd` Command Examples

| Example | Description                                                                 |
|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `pwd`   | Print the **full path** of your current working directory.                 |

---

ðŸ’¡ **Usage Notes**:
- `pwd` stands for "print working directory".
- Itâ€™s often the first command you use to confirm your location in the filesystem.
- The output is always an **absolute path** starting from `/`.

## ðŸ“‚ `mv` Command Examples

| Example                        | Description                                                   |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|

| `mv file.txt /path/to/dir/`    | Move `file.txt` into `/path/to/dir/`.                       |
| `mv file1 file2 file3 /tmp/`   | Move multiple files into `/tmp/`.                          |
| `mv dir1 newdirname`           | Rename directory `dir1` to `newdirname`.                    |
| `mv -i file1 file2`            | **Prompt before overwriting** file2 if it exists.          |
| `mv -v file1 file2`            | **Verbose mode** â€” show whatâ€™s being moved/renamed.         |
| `mv -n file1 file2`            | **Do not overwrite** existing file2.                        |

---

ðŸ’¡ **Usage Notes**:
- `mv` works across directories and files â€” itâ€™s also your basic `rename`.
- Combine options like `mv -iv` for interactive & verbose.
- If you `mv` across filesystems (e.g. different drives), it will actually copy and then delete the original.
